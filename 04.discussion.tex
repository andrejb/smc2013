\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

From the results of our experiments, it is obvious that implementation details
make a big difference in the amount of computation. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item The types used (byte, unsigned long, int, float, etc) are
    fundamental.
    \item Integer multiplication/division takes at least double time than
    operations on integers only.
    \item The amount of loops make a difference.
    \item Consulting variables also makes a difference.
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Future work}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Use ADC interrupt in asynchronous mode to find out the maximum sample rate
    the microcontroller can achieve and compare with specifications.
    \item Make use of 10-bit ADC input and adapt tests for performing 2 byte operations. We can expect each operation to cost much more time becaue of the 8 bit nature of the processor.
     \item Try to determine the the amount of noise introduced in the signal by the ADC sampling/PWM synthesis process.
\end{itemize}
